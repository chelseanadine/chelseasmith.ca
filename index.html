    <p>Hi! Welcome to my online portfolio. I have a passion for art and design. I have been doing freelance design work for almost a decade. I also have experience working for companies in marketing, e-commerce, and administrative departments as well. Even in my spare time, most of my hobbies reflect my artistic inclinations. Iâ€™ve always been interested in all things creative, from painting and sketching all the way to elaborate outdoor installations for Halloween.</p>
    <p>I have expertise in illustration, marketing, branding, and photography, but my skill sets stretch out to many other branches within graphic design as well. More detailed physical and digital mixed media portfolios are available upon request.</p>
