Ever since I was a toddler, I would always say that I wanted to be an artist when I grew up. It was instinctual for me to reach for markers and paper and start drawing. My passion for creating has never wavered.

I studied fine/creative arts throughout high school, and that eventually led me to take media arts courses as well. When it was time for me to think about post-secondary, I decided to venture into the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College’s School of Media and Design. I have also been doing freelance design work as well as office/firm experience over the past decade on top of this.

It feels right to be where I am today. Hopefully you’ll get a sense for who I am through here too.
